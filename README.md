# the-US-Housing-Price-Project
time series analysis in R

In my study group's project on identifying the best fitting model to the time series of the new one-family houses sold in
the United States over the period of January 1995 to November 2016.  
We transformed the data to be stationary, determined the most adequate SARIMA model by running residual diagnostics, 
dropped last 10 values and predicted the number of new one family houses sold in the United States for these 10 months, 
and compared with the actual values.
